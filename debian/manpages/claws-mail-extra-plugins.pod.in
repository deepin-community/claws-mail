claws-mail-extra-plugins - extra plugins meta-package for Claws Mail

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<claws-mail-extra-plugins> is a meta package for installing all extra
plugins for the I<Claws Mail> mailer.

The manpage names corresponding to each available plugin can be found in
the B<SEE ALSO> section.

=head1 HISTORY

The extra plugins is a collection of plugins which was initially
released as a separate tarball download containing all the contributed
plugins from the I<Claws Mail> website.

To allow faster releases, early in 2013 all the extra plugins were
incorporated to the main CVS tree, next to the core plugins. Since then
all of them were included in the main release tarball.
