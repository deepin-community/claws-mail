=head1 NAME

claws-mail-spamassassin - filter messages through SpamAssassin

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<claws-mail-spamassassin>
package.

This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

B<claws-mail-spamassassin> is a plugin (loadable module) for the I<Claws
Mail> mailer.

This plugin allows filtering incoming mails usin SpamAssassin to detect
spam messages.

The plugin also provides the ability to teach B<spamd> to recognize spam
and ham, using the external command B<sa-learn> in local modes or
B<spamd> in TCP mode (this one requires SpamAssassin >= 3.1.x).

A toolbar button for marking messages as spam or ham can be added to the
main window or the message window (see “Configuration” menu,
“Preferences” dialog, “Customize toolbars” option).

Messages classified as spam are moved to the configured folder or the
default trash if no folder was configured.

=head1 USAGE

Before using a plugin you must instruct I<Claws Mail> to load it on
startup.

For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open
“Plugins...” dialog, click on the “Load plugin...” button and select
the plugin file, named B<spamassassin.so>, and press the “Open” button.
