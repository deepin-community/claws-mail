=head1 NAME

claws-mail-bogofilter - scanning mails for spam with Bogofilter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<claws-mail-bogofilter> package.

This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

B<claws-mail-bogofilter> is a plugin (loadable module) for the I<Claws
Mail> mailer.

This plugin allows scanning incoming mails using bogofilter to decide if
they are spam or not.

Bogofilter can also be taught to recognise spam or ham messages with the
corresponding menu entries.

=head1 USAGE

Before using a plugin you must instruct I<Claws Mail> to load it on
startup.

For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open
“Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select
the plugin file, named B<bogofilter.so>, and press the “Open” button.
