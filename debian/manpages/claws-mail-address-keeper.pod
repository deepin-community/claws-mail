claws-mail-address-keeper - keep outgoing addresses in address book

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<claws-mail-address-keeper>
package.

This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page

B<claws-mail-address-keeper> is a plugin (loadable module) for the
I<Claws Mail> mailer.

It allows saving typed outgoing addresses to address book automatically
in case they are unknown, i.e., not already present in the address book.

=head1 USAGE

Before using a plugin you must instruct I<Claws Mail> to load it on
startup.

For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open
“Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select
the plugin file, named B<address_keeper.so>, and press the “Open”
button.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Messages have to be sent or saved for later sending for the address
collection to work. Addresses will be saved regardless the success of
the sending operation.
