claws-mail-archiver-plugin - archive messages to compressed files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<claws-mail-archiver-plugin>
package.

This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

B<claws-mail-archiver-plugin> is a plugin (loadable module) for the
I<Claws Mail> mailer.

This plugin uses libarchive to extend I<Claws Mail> features with
archiving capabilities. Several archive formats are available, with or
without compression.

=head1 USAGE

Before using a plugin you must instruct I<Claws Mail> to load it on
startup.

For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open
“Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select
the plugin file, named B<archive.so>, and press the “Open” button.
