claws-mail-bsfilter-plugin - spam filtering using the bsfilter program

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<claws-mail-bsfilter-plugin>
package.

This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

B<claws-mail-bsfilter-plugin> is a plugin (loadable module) for the
I<Claws Mail> mailer.

Enables spam mails to be feed to the bsfilter program so it can learn to
filter them out.

=head1 USAGE

Before using a plugin you must instruct I<Claws Mail> to load it on
startup.

For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open
“Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select
the plugin file, named B<bsfilter.so>, and press the “Open” button.
