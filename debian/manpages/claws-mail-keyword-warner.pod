=head1 NAME

claws-mail-keyword-warner - missing keywords warning before sending

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<claws-mail-keyword-warner>
package.

This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

B<claws-mail-keyword-warner> is a plugin (loadable module) for the
I<Claws Mail> mailer.

It warns the user if one or more of the configured keywords are mentioned
in the text of the mail message being sent or queued.

Mentions are found by simple regex matching, although some care is taken
to avoid false positives.

=head1 USAGE

Before using a plugin you must instruct I<Claws Mail> to load it on
startup.

For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open
“Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select
the plugin file, named B<keyword_warner.so>, and press the “Open” button.
