=head1 NAME

claws-mail-attach-remover - remove attachments from mail messages

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<claws-mail-attach-remover>
package.

This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

B<claws-mail-attach-remover> is a plugin (loadable module) for the
I<Claws Mail> mailer.

Enables the removal of all attachments from the selected message. When
doing right-click a message on message list, choose the “Remove
attachments” option from the displayed submenu.

=head1 USAGE

Before using a plugin you must instruct I<Claws Mail> to load it on
startup.

For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open
“Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select
the plugin file, named B<att_remover.so>, and press the “Open” button.

=head1 CAVEATS

Currently there is no way you can select individual attachments for
removal. It's all or nothing.
