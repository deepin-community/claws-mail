=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<claws-mail-tnef-parser>
package.

This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

B<claws-mail-tnef-parser> is a plugin (loadable module) for the I<Claws
Mail> mailer.

Allows decoding of attachments with C<application/ms-tnef> MIME type
within I<Claws Mail>. These attachments are also known as C<winmail.dat>
files.

=head1 USAGE

Before using a plugin you must instruct I<Claws Mail> to load it on
startup.

For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open
“Plugins...” dialog, click on the “Load plugin...” button and select
the plugin file, named B<tnef_parse.so>, and press the “Open” button.
